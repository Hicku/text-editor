# Title: Just Another Text Editor (JATE)

## Description
Just Another Text Editor is a browser-based text editor. With JATE, you can create and edit text documents directly in your browser.

## Features

1. Offline Capability: JATE utilizes service worker and IndexedDB technologies, allowing you to access and use the application even when you're offline.

2. Auto-Save Functionality: Your work is automatically saved in the background whenever you click outside the text editor's window. This ensures that your content is preserved, even if you accidentally close the browser or navigate away from the page.

3. Easy Installation: You can use the install button, which enables you to download the application as an icon on your desktop. This allows for quick and easy access to the text editor, even without an internet connection.

## Usage
To start using JATE, simply open the application in your preferred browser. JATE automatically creates a database storage using IndexedDB. You can then begin typing, editing, and formatting your text within the editor.
